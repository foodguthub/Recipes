(currently [available in the Bank](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=zCoDc3SSi24I.korG11Dfhm4A))

**Ingredients**
* 4 or 5 heads of red or green cabbage
* 1/4 cup salt

**Preparation**
* 1. Place the shredded cabbage little by little in your fermentation jar
* 2. During the (1) keep pressing the cabbage vigorously and sprinkle with the salt as you go
* 3. Make sure you fill the jar up to top (leave cca 1inch free for the expansion that will happen)
* 4. Create a brine of 2 tablespoons salt to 4 cups water and pour it over
* 5. Use one cabbage leaf as a cover - close the jar (or use a clean cloth + sth heavy to keep it covered)
* 6. Let it ferment in a room temperature for 7 to 10 days
* 7. Check + taste regularly (brine needs to cover all cabbage leaves all the time; remove any mold that 
may form on the surface
* 8. move it to the refrigerator when youâ€™re satisfied with the taste and texture (I like not-so-sour and crunchy).
* 9. use the [brine as a starter](https://github.com/foodguthub/Fermentation-Bank/blob/master/whatsthere.md) for another sauerkraut batch
