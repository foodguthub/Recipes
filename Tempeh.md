#Tempeh!

**Ingredients**

* 2 cups hulled soy beans 
* 2 tablespoons vinegar
* 3/4 teaspoon (1 packet) [tempeh starter](http://github.com/foodguthub/Fermentation-Bank)

**Instructions**

Boil the soybeans for cca one hour. Discard the cooking water, dry the beans 
(important - too much moisture can ruin everything).


Place the beans in a dry bowl and allow the beans to cool to a room temperature (mind the geographics - 25-ish C).
Add the vinegar and mix well. Add the starter and mix well to evenly distribute the starter in the beans 
(if you use tempeh tablets, crush them into powder)


Place the beans into container (or quart-size plastic bags with needle-size holes poked through at 1/2-inch intervals).
Incubate the beans at 30Â°C for 24 to 48 hours.


Check the beans after 12 hours. At this point in the process the fermentation will cause the beans to generate 
their own heat so you will normally need to reduce or even eliminate the external heat source. 


After 24 hours or so, the white mycelium will start to cover the surface of the beans. 
Over the next few hours the white mycelium will grow through the beans and will smell nutty.
After 24 to 48 hours, when the beans have become a single mass held together by the white spores,
the tempeh can be refrigerated.

Eat! or store in a fridge..
