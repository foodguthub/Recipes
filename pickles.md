## super easy how-to re: mixed pickled vegetables ##

**Ingredients:**

Any veggies you find around - we found these:

* 3 pcs Carrots
* 2 pcs Cucumber
* 1 pc Cauliflower
* 1 pc Chinese Raddish
* 1 pc Onion
* 1 pc White Cabbage
* 1 pc Red Cabbage
* Salt for the brine (works as a starter here, but if you want to have a better control over the microbes in your jar, you can also use whey or [buy freeze-dried starter](http://www.culturesforhealth.com/cutting-edge-starter-culture-for-fresh-vegetables.html)..but you really don't need to, salt works very well)

**Other gizmo:**

* Mason jar or ceramic crock pot (large enough to host all the veggies, we use 4 liter glass jar)
* Knife
* Spoon to stir the brine
* Bowl to mix the brine (salt solution)
* Cutting board

**Total time:**

* Depends how fast you cut la

**So how?**

* 1. Wash the veggies
* 2. Slice carrots & radish, cut cucumber and onions into quarters, break cauliflower into few smaller-ish pieces...
* 3. Fold them into the the jar somehow smartly (just make them look nice ok)
* 4. Prepare the salt solution - use well or filtered watter; 4 liter jar = 6 tbl spoons salt (but it can be more..or less..the more you put, the more you "prevent" the microbes from going crazy, but you don't want to overdose your guts with salt - in fact, you can also ferment without salt)
* 5. Pour it over the veggies, stir, and press with hand (a lot, the jar needs to be stuffed, all veggies submerged)
* 6. Tear one cabbage leaf and use it to cover all that..
* 7. Close your jar, leave it in a room temperature, go on doing whatever else you want to do that day
* 8. Check your jar regularly: open it, let it "burp" (oxygen out); stirr; taste (you want crunchy sour veggies - need to catch the moment when they become fermented/sour but are still crunchy/not mushy); if there is a mold on the surface, just take it out with spoon and don't panic 
* 9. After 2-4 weeks it should all be done (depends on temperature: higher=faster)
* 10. Now eat (if for some reason you don't finish the whole jar at once, put it into a fridge)
